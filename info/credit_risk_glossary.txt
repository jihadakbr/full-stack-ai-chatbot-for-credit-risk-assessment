Credit Risk & Machine Learning Glossary

1. Credit Score  
   A numerical representation of a borrowerâ€™s creditworthiness, typically based on payment history, outstanding debt, and length of credit history.

2. Default  
   The failure of a borrower to make required payments on a loan.

3. Probability of Default (PD)  
   The likelihood that a borrower will default on a loan within a given time horizon, often estimated using predictive models.

4. Interest Rate
   The percentage charged by a lender for borrowing money, typically expressed annually.

5. Credit Bureau
   An organization that collects and maintains credit information on individuals and businesses.

6. Prepayment
   Paying off part or all of a loan before the scheduled due date, sometimes subject to conditions.

7. Fair Lending  
   Practices and regulations designed to ensure borrowers are treated equally, regardless of race, gender, age, or other protected characteristics.

8. KYC (Know Your Customer)  
   Regulatory process to verify the identity of borrowers and assess risk of illegal activities such as fraud or money laundering.

9. Delinquency  
   A situation where a borrower misses loan payments but has not yet defaulted.

10. Collateral  
    An asset pledged by a borrower to secure a loan, which may be seized if the borrower defaults.

11. Portfolio Diversification  
    Spreading credit exposure across different borrowers, industries, or geographies to reduce risk.

12. Feature Engineering  
    The process of creating, transforming, or selecting variables (features) to improve the predictive power of machine learning models.

13. Model Bias  
    Systematic errors in a machine learning model that can unfairly disadvantage certain groups of borrowers.

14. Overfitting  
    A modeling error where the algorithm performs well on training data but poorly on unseen data, reducing generalizability.

15. Explainability (XAI)  
    Techniques used to make machine learning model decisions transparent and understandable, especially important in credit decisions.

16. ROC Curve & AUC  
    Metrics used to evaluate classification models. The ROC curve shows the trade-off between true positive and false positive rates; AUC (Area Under Curve) summarizes performance.

17. Responsible AI
    The ethical use of artificial intelligence, ensuring fairness, transparency, and compliance in credit risk modeling.
